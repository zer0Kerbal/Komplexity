### The goal of these resources

These materials are designed to help those new to Git, GitHub and software development as a whole. By using these cheatsheets, we hope users will:

- Feel welcome and become active contributors in the open source community
- Learn best practices for using Git, GitHub and other GitHub supported projects such as Electron, Atom, etc
- Learn how to use the applications within GitHub's ecosystem to build better software

### Types of contributions we love

We're always looking for contributions to help improve these resources. This includes:

- Improving the existing cheatsheets
- Translations of existing cheatsheets into new languages
- Adding new classes or resources aligned with the [goals](#the-goal-of-these-resources)

## How to contribute

### Report a bug

Oops, thanks for finding that! If you know how to fix it, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a change via Pull Request.

If you aren't sure how to fix it or just don't have time, we invite you to open a [new Issue](https://github.com/github/training-kit/issues/new). Please be sure to provide information so we can recreate the error.

### Translate existing resources

Several community members have been kind enough to translate the Git Cheat Sheets into various languages. At this time, we are only set up to serve the cheat sheets in various languages (but maybe you can help us change that :wink:) If you are planning to contribute a translation, please do the following:

- Fork this repository
- Create a new folder in the [downloads directory](https://github.com/github/training-kit/tree/master/downloads) using the standard abbreviation for the language you are providing.
- Copy the most recent [English version of the cheatsheet](https://github.com/github/training-kit/blob/master/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.md) to the folder you created.
- Complete the translation
- Add a link to the translated resource on [/index.html](https://github.com/github/training-kit/blob/master/index.html)
- Open a pull request against the `master` branch of this repository.
- Be sure to @ mention a couple of your friends who are native speakers and ask them to review the translation.
- Update your translation based on feedback from your friends.

When this process is complete, we will be happy to merge the completed document.

### Contribute something new

Whether you have an idea to make it better, or want to contribute a whole new course or resource ... we :heart: new ideas! We invite you to open a new [Issue](https://github.com/github/training-kit/issues/new) to talk about it before you invest too much time. Of course, if you want to experiment first, you can [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) and submit your idea via a Pull Request.

When you are contributing something new, we ask you to be familiar with our content philosophy, the structure of the repository, and building [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) sites locally. See the sections below for more information.

### Not sure where to start?

If you just want to help out, but don't have a particular change in mind, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/github/training-kit/issues) for projects you can tackle, review an [open pull request](https://github.com/github/training-kit/pulls), or check out [the project ROADMAP](https://github.com/github/training-kit/projects/1).

### Styling content

This site uses GitHub's CSS toolkit called [Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer-css). It's easy to use, and if your contribution requires some design or front-end work you should check out the [Primer Docs](http://primercss.io/).

### Building and testing

When you are ready to test your changes, you will want to build the repository locally. This is fully automated through a series of shell scripts based [the scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)!

To build the materials do the following:

1. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the dependencies
1. Run `script/build` to build the site
1. Run `script/server`
    - When successful, the script will initiate a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.
1. Simply paste that into your favorite web-browser and you will be ready to test
